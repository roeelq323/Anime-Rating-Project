## Predicting Anime rating:
Anime is animation originating from Japan. Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan, however, in Japan and in Japanese, anime describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin.

Anime became more popular over the years and we wanted to try and predict people's rating of an Anime series based on its attributes.
The data we used is from MyAnimeList, a website which provides information on all the Anime's that ever existed. The website also provides users rating for each Anime which we will try and predict. 
Using the data on the MAL website and machine learning algorithms we will try and classify Animes rating based on the Anime's parameters.
